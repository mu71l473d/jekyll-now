title: My thoughts on system administration.
---

Within my education an through personal interest,
IÂ´ve read about the practice of System Administration. Thomas Limoncelli, et al. wrote a book called "The Art of System and Network Administration".
The processes and practices that are described in this book are one of the guidelines that are used by me throughout my starting career.

In this book they describe the basic principles of system administration:
- Automation: software replaces replace human effort. We should not be doing tasks, We should be maintaining. Automation improves repeatability and scalability which leads to consistency.
	Furthermore, it lowers the System administrator's burden. It starts with defining the process and making it repeatable. After the repeatable process is documented, it can be turned into code.
- Small batches: Small increments in code compared to large batches deliver results faster, with higher quality and less stress. 
- End-to-end integration: Working across teams to achieve the best total result. prevents Silo infrastructure
- Self-service systems: tools that emppower others to work independently. should be an enablement platform not a control structure
- communication: right people can solve more problems than hardware/software can. communicate with other SA and customers to work towards the same goal
	documentation is also included.
