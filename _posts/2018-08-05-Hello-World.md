This blogpost will be used to show my progress, projects or other fun activities mostly related to IT. 
I hope you will enjoy the posts as much as i will be making them. 

Closing thought: Einstein said that the best way to learn something is to teach someone else. I hope that my blogs will be 
informative to the reader and that sometimes you will let out a little groan because of my terrible sense of humor.
