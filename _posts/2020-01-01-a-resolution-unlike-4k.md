As mentioned on my LinkedIn post. There's a piece from the book "Be the master" by Don Jones, that really stuck by me: "We have all, at some point, been an apprentice. Most of us are at “apprentice stage” in some topic or another for most of our lives. Many of us have had the benefit of learning, at least briefly, from a “Master” in our respective trade. Too few people, however, go on to become a Master themselves. You see, the point of a Master is not to know it all. [..]
Too often, we equate the term Master with expert, and we feel that,until we reach that ineffable “expert” state, we are not worthy to pass along what we know. This is bullshit. In our modern, always connected world, every bit of experience—not knowledge, but true experience—is valuable and worthy of being passed along. Indeed,I feel we owe it to those who taught us to turn around and reteach it, whatever “it” is, to others. We evolve our trade, and we help ensure its survival. To not become the Master is to be a failure as an apprentice. To not become a teacher is to be selfish and to be unworthy of being taught."

Within the field of IT security (and several other subjects) I've been standing on the shoulders of giants, and decided to contribute back more in 2020, so that other can also learn from me as i've learned from others.
