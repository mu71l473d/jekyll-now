title: Short thoughts on the nothing to hide argument

---
Within this blogpost, I will talk about some thoughts and ideas about why the nothing to hide, nothing to fear argument is invalid.


### [Brief history of Privacy](#brief-history-of-privacy)

In the early twenty-first century, over 100 years ago, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis “Warned of emerging threats to individual liberty associated with new business methods and technologies. Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life." Warren and Brandeis worried, in particular, about the press “overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery.” They asked for legal adoption of the “right to be let alone.” This right was in their eyes “the right to one’s personality.” Today, threats to privacy are much more abstract in the form of of surveillance, the biotechnology revolution including biometrics and facial recognition, the rise of the digital technology, and the continuing war on terror.
                                                    


### [Nothing to hide?](#nothing-to-hide)
Many of us have heard the statement: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” First of all, all of us have something to hide, at least information that we don’t want everyone to know. Privacy is not only an individual right but also a social value. Daniel Solove said that "Privacy is not the trumpeting of the individual against society’s interests, but the protection of the individual based on society’s norms and values" [..] "But the problem with the privacy at the moment is that “Those who have power have the luxury power of defining what is and what is not private."" In his TED talk, Glenn Greenwald responded to the nothing to hide statement with: Send me all your email address credentials, not only the nice onces but all of your email addresses. I'll decide on whether i'll go read through them at my own time. If you say that you have nothing to hide, then you should have absolutely nothing to fear. No one took him op on his offer. 

Other noteful responses are:
* “So do you have curtains?” or “Can I see your credit or debit card bills for the last year?”
* I don’t have anything to hide. But I don’t have anything I feel like showing you, either.
* If you have nothing to hide, then you don’t have a life.
* It’s not about having anything to hide, it’s about things not being anyone else’s business.
* Bottom line, Joe Stalin would have loved it. Why should anyone have to say more?


To describe the problems created by the collection and use of personal data, a lot of authors refer to George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. This totalitarian society ruled is by a government called Big Brother. Big Brother watched its citizens obsessively through telescreens. "There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live --did live, from habit that became instinct --in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized." The Orwell metaphor, which focuses on the harms of surveillance (such as inhibition and social control), might be apt to describe government monitoring of citizens. But much of the data gathered in computer databases isn’t particularly sensitive, such as one’s race, birth date, gender, address, or marital status. Many people don’t care about concealing the hotels they stay at, the cars they own, or the kind of beverages they drink. Often people are not embarrassed if others know this information.

Franz Kafka’s The Trial provides another metaphor. Kafka’s novel centers around a man who is arrested but not informed why. He desperately tries to find out what triggered his arrest and what’s in store for him. He finds out that a mysterious court system has a dossier on him and is investigating him, but he’s unable to learn much more. In the end, the main theme is: when you have enough data about someome, you can always find something and make it stick. This shows the problems of information processing: the storage, use, or analysis of data—rather than just information collection. They affect the power relationships between people. A disputed quote, attributed to Cardinal Richeleu states: "Give me six lines written by the most honest man, and I will find something there to hang him." Maybe the collection is not the biggest problem, but the way it will be stored, used or analyzed.

The way I personally see it is: Imagine that you're walking on the street. You have the feeling of being followed. When you look behind you you see a person constantly taking notes about something, you then realize that those notes are about you. Everytime you look back he or she is still there, constantly scribbling notes. Would that person make you uncomfortable? Would you still act in the same way, when you know that you're being observed?
